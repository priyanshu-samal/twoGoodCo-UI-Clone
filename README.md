This project is a clone of the Twogood Co website that I created as part of my learning journey in web development.
It encompasses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the integration of libraries such as Locomotive Scroll and GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform).
Through this project, I aimed to deepen my understanding of front-end development principles and improve my skills in building responsive and interactive websites.
